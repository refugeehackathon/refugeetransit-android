No buses are running from the transit places connected to the beaches because the camps are over capacity which makes the situation unbearable in the small villages.\n\nIt's not possible to give all the help the refugees need, risk of separating families, hypothermia, dead bodies coming with boats or floating to shore and even a woman giving birth with only volunteers to help.\n\nFamilies are sleeping outside and the weather conditions and also restrictions on boats leaving in the day makes the trips even more dangerous as so many people come by night and wet and cold. \n\nSkala Sikamineas has been reported as the major landing spot for boats at this moment.\n\nMost of the times refugees arrive completely wet, so it's a good thing they can change their clothes when they get to the island.\n\nSwedish volunteers are mainly coordinating in the beach.
